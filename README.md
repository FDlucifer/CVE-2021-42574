# CVE-2021-42574 - Code generator
Generate malicious files using recently published bidi-attack vulnerability, which was discovered in Unicode Specification and affects many interpreters / compilers.

Cite from [cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42574):
> An issue was discovered in the Bidirectional Algorithm in the Unicode Specification through 14.0. It permits the visual reordering of characters via control sequences, which can be used to craft source code that renders different logic than the logical ordering of tokens ingested by compilers and interpreters. Adversaries can leverage this to encode source code for compilers accepting Unicode such that targeted vulnerabilities are introduced invisibly to human reviewers.

## Usage
`python3 codegen.py [-h] [-i INFILE] [-o OUTFILE] [-u] [-a]`
| arg | long arg | param | description |
|-----|----------|-------|-------------|
| -h  | --help   | none  | show this help message and exit |
| -i  | --infile | INFILE | Input file (template) containing unicode placeholders |
| -o  | --outfile | OUTFILE | Output file to store the final code |
| -u  | --uctable | none | Supported bidi-related characters |
| -a  | --about  | none  | Print about text |

## Examples
Both `test.c` and `test.py` are taken from the referenced PDF. To run these examples, execute `codegen.py` with the required arguments:

`python3 codegen.py -i test.c -o filename.c`, compile the output `gcc filename.c -o filename` and run the file `./filename`

`python3 codegen.py -i test.py -o filename.py` and run the file `python3 filename.py`
